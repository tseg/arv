ARV is Web Application developed to help automate the Associative Remote Viewing (ARV) process and minimize time needed while managing a group of Remote Viewers.
The work flow is similar to ARV done by the Greg with some alteration (like the introduction of viewers group and judges are different from the viewers)
 
The group viewers attempts to visualize an image and produces a sketch and upload it using their user account. The judges login to system to see viewers image 
plus two images (target images has secret designation UP/DOW) randomly selected by the system from the library. Then judges selects the image that is most 
similar to the image from the viewer and assign the rate and confidence value.  Then the system automatically place bet on the ETF according to the direction 
designation assigned to the target image chosen the voting algorithm. 
 
After the trading day expire the system determine the direction and amount ETF. The viewers will be shown the image that was associated to the direction of
 outcome of the actual change in the ETF.
